    "## Your Time to Code\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the current trajectory has several issues.\n",
    "First of all it, collides with the asteroids.\n",
    "Second, it exceeds both the thrust and velocity limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We left a cell with comments only in the center of the definition of the optimization problem.\n",
    "Your goal is to work on that cell to improve the rocket trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're required to add three groups of constraints:\n",
    "- **Thrust limits.**\n",
    "The class `Rocket` has the attribute `thrust_limit`.\n",
    "For each time step `t`, add a constraint that requires the norm of the rocket thrust vector to be lower or equal to the `thrust_limit`.\n",
    "- **Velocity limits.**\n",
    "For each time step `t`, add a constraint that requires the norm of the rocket velocity (third and fourth components of the state) to be lower or equal to the `velocity_limit` from the `Rocket` class.\n",
    "- **Avoid collision with asteroids.**\n",
    "Each asteroid in the `universe` has the attribute `orbit`.\n",
    "This is the radius of a danger orbit where we don't want our rocket to end up.\n",
    "For each time step `t` and for each asteroid, add a constraint that requires distance between the rocket and the asteroid to be greater or equal to the asteroid's `orbit`.\n",
    "- **Minimize fuel consumption.**\n",
    "To ensure that all these extra constraints do not lead to crazy trajectories, add an objective function that minimizes the (discrete-time approximation) of the integral of the thrust squared: $$h \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \\| \\mathbf{u}[t] \\|^2,$$ where $h$ is the time interval (`time_interval` in the code), $t$ is the time step, $T$ is the number of time steps (`time_steps` in the code), $\\mathbf{u}[t]$ is the 2D thrust at discrete time $t$ (`thrust[t]` in the code).\n",
    "The current fuel consumption can be verifies using the function `fuel_consumption` defined above.\n",
    "The goal for you is to keep the consumption lower than 250 (expressed in the scaled units).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're struggling trying to find the right functions to complete your task, here are two great resources:\n",
    "- [Drake's MathematicalProgram documentation](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1solvers_1_1_mathematical_program.html).\n",
    "This is the `C++` documentation, but it's very useful to see which methods `MathematicalProgram` implements and what you need to pass to them.\n",
    "- [Drake's nonlinear-programming tutorial](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RobotLocomotion/drake/nightly-release?filepath=tutorials).\n",
    "Here you'll find usage examples of all the `MathematicalProgram` methods you need to complete this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Troubleshooting:**\n",
    "Nonlinear optimization solvers are extremely sensitive.\n",
    "Different OSs can give different results.\n",
    "Even worse, sometimes, enforcing the same constraints in a different order, you can make these solvers find a solution to a problem that they previously said was infeasible!\n",
    "In our Colab testings, we implemented the constraints in the order given above, and we got full score.\n",
    "However, in case you believe that your implementation is correct but you still don't get full score from the autograder, feel free to play with the initial-guess parameters (e.g. the random seed)."
